# **what?**
# This workflow builds python packages and ensures they can be
# installed on supported OS and python versions. This workflow should not require
# any secrets since it will run for all pushes, PRs, and
# forked PRs. Secrets are not passed to workflows from forked PRs.

# **why?**
# Ensure that dbt and its dependencies are able to be packaged
# and installed.

# **when?**
# This will run when pushing to protected branches, pull requests,
# and manual dispatch.
